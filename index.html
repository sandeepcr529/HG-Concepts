<h2>Version Control Systems</h2>

<p>A version control system is an essential part of software development. Starting a long running project with out some kind of version control is similar to venturing into a think forest with no way to find your way back. It gives context for your code. Every line of code you write will ultimately become part of a single commit with a clear purpose.  </p>

<p>Any version control system will have two main entities. The repo and the working directory.</p>

<h2>The Working Directory</h2>

<p>A mercurial repo takes the form of a directory named .hg in the root of your project folder. For all intents and purposes, this IS the repo. It contains all the history of your project from the beginning of time. You can copy this directory to a different location and you will have a repo there. </p>
