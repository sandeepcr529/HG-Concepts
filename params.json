Starting a project with out some kind of version control is similar to venturing deep into a thick forest with no way to find your way back. It gives context for your code. Every line of code you write will ultimately become part of a single commit with a clear purpose. \r\n\r\nAny version control system will have three main entities. The tracked files, the working directory and the repository.\r\n\r\n##The Tracked Files\r\n\r\nA code version system is a system to manage the source code of your project. But your project will almost always contains files that are not code/text. This includes binary files like images, videos, user uploaded files. There will be log files that does not make much sense to be version controlled. These files can be excluded from version control. So you have a set of files that you want to be \r\nversion controlled or 'tracked' by mercurial, and you have a set of files that you don't want it to track.\r\n\r\nWhen a new mercurial repository is created, there will be no tracked files initially. You have to manually add all files that are to be tracked in the future. This is done by a command, `hg add`, which we will see in detail later.\r\n\r\n## The Working Directory\r\n\r\nThe working directory is the directory that hold all the files of your project, tracked or not. We will come back to this later.\r\n\r\n## The Repository or Repo\r\n\r\nA mercurial repository takes the form of a directory named .hg in the root of your working directory. \r\nYou create a mercurial repository for your project by running the command from the root of your project folder.\r\n\r\n`hg init`\r\n\r\nThis creates the .hg directory. For all intents and purposes, this IS the repository. After a while it will contain all the history of your project(tracked files) from the beginning of time. You can copy this directory to a different location and you will have a repository there. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
